This work aims to find innovative solutions to the problem of manually detecting defects or damages in building's walls that require significant resources and time. The proposed solutions aim to create an automated inspection system that can effectively and efficiently detect areas that require maintenance or repair. 
In terms of implementation, a mobile robot used along with ROS packages and tools to manage data from sensors and integrate different algorithms to perform analysis and inspections. It will incorporate machine learning algorithms to analyze the input images from the camera and identify any cracks or structural defects. 
The automated inspection system's data and results can be accessed remotely, providing a comprehensive report with detailed information about their building's condition. The solution aims to enhance building safety, improve maintenance, and prevent long-term damage to the structure.
